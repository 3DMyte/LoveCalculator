# LoveCalculator
This is a simple <b>Love Calculator</b> which displays <b>love percentage</b> based on <b>names</b>. We all know that a name can tell a lot about a person. Names are not randomly chosen: they all have a meaning. <b>Psychologist</b> knew this so they made another great invention just for the <b>LONELY YOU!</b>

Love calculation by a love calculator is based on certain algorithm. Once two names are entered, this calculator matches the name of the first person against some love, romance and relationship related parameters. Similarly the name of your partner/lover is matched against the same parameters. The love calculator's algorithm then detects how many parameters you both have in common. It is based on this analysis that the calculator reaches the conclusion and displays love percentage or compatibility.
